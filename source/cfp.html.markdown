title: Call for Proposals
---

We'd like to see proposals on a wide range of subjects, ranging from the theory behind to the application of functional programming. How does it influence your design, what are possible drawbacks, and so on. Topics could include (but are definitely not limited to):

- New features and possibilities
  - Autoclosures, type-system, generics, overloading, ...
- Dealing with existing APIs
  - e.g. Either vs. NSError 
  - Wrappers around Cocoa APIs
- Libraries
  - QuickCheck, Actors, STM, ...
- DSLs
  - Build completely new or port existing DSLs...
- Experiences with FP in Swift
  - (even though it's extremely new)...

Of course, there are many things missing from the list above, please feel free to suggest any other talk ideas as well!
Because it's a free conference, with no money involved, we unfortunately can't cover travel or accomodation.

Here's [the form for filling out your proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cQgYngA-BuhIfOhk1PHpMer9tS8kVsgviRIv4HeVBDk/viewform?usp=send_form).

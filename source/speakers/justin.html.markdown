iOS and Mac apps rely heavily on state to change their presentation and respond to inputâ€”it's hard to imagine writing an app without the use of properties and variables. However, state is a huge source of needless complexity, and responsible for most of the easily avoidable bugs that users encounter.

This talk explains what state is, details exactly why it's so harmful, and offers ways to minimize and avoid state, making the apps we develop simpler and more reliable.

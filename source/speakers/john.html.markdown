Networking with Monads

* Discuss what makes a monad (bind / return)
* Show how Optional and Result are monads
* Discuss "Deferred" (Swift implementation of <http://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/108.00.02/doc/async_core/Deferred.html>)
* Briefly mention monad transformers (for working with `Deferred<Result<T>>`)
* Demo simple chat client/server that uses all of these concepts (e.g., how "connect and handshake" is relatively simple with monadic error handling)

          <h3></h3>

      <p>We think that diversity is important: we think that people are diverse, problems and opportunities are diverse, and conferences are better when they reflect that. This is our inclusivity policy, which sets out how we try to support diversity ensure the conference is a safe and welcoming place.</p>

<p>We believe that anyone should feel welcome, included, and safe at our conference. That means anyone, irrespective of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, dietary requirements, or childcare needs.</p>

<p>We’ll do everything we can to accommodate people’s needs. All we ask is that, if you know you’re going to need something, you <a href="/#organizers">tell us</a> about it before the event (the sooner the better!).</p>

<p>Second, we won’t tolerate staff, speakers, attendees, or sponsors engaging in behaviour that excludes people, whether that’s harassment, bullying, overt or covert racism or sexism, or any other offensive behavior. (Not tolerating means we’ll eject people, without refund, if we have to.)</p>

<h2 id="diet">Diet</h2>

<p>If you have special dietary requirements please let us know. If you require something very particular <a href="/#organizers">please ask</a> first so we can confirm with our caterers.</p>

<h2 id="harassment">Harassment</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Anyone asked to stop harassing behaviour is expected to do so, immediately.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please <a href="/#organizers">contact one of the organizing team</a> immediately.</p>

<p>The organizing team will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

<p>(This policy is based on work done by <a href="http://www.uikonf.com">UIKonf</a>, the <a href="http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/">Ada Initiative</a> and <a href="http://2013.eurucamp.org/policies">Eurucamp</a>. Thanks for your help!)</p>
